        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe for salt and pepper ribs reminded me just how delicious
            pork ribs are when we don't try to do too much to them. They say
            that whoever makes the most delicious thing with the fewest number
            of ingredients wins, which was the idea that inspired these. Plus,
            this has to be the easiest method I've ever shared for doing ribs.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 rack St. Louis-style pork spare ribs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix salt, black pepper, white pepper, cayenne, and garlic powder
                together in a small bowl. Set spice rub aside.
            </li>
            <li>Stir vinegar and Dijon mustard together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>
                Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet. Turn the ribs over so
                that the meat side is down. Use the tip of a small, sharp knife
                to make some very shallow slashes every few inches through the
                membrane that covers the ribs. Poke the knife 3 or 4 times
                between each rib bone, about 1/4 inch deep.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush about 1/2 of the Dijon mustard mixture on top. Sprinkle
                with about 40% of the spice rub. Turn the rack over and brush on
                the rest of the mustard and vinegar mixture. Sprinkle on the
                rest of the rub, reserving 1 or 2 teaspoons in case you want to
                use it to season the cooked ribs later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate the ribs, uncovered, 4 to 12 hours before baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Remove ribs
                from the refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook in the center of the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove
                from the oven and baste with the pan drippings. Continue to cook
                until very tender and the tip of a knife slides in very easily,
                about 1 1/2 hours more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven, baste again, and let ribs rest for 15
                minutes before cutting and serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
